## Horiseon Code Refactor Project
 
 ### Description
 ####This project was built in order to refactor the existing code of the site "Horiseon"
 The original code was messy and did not follow HTML5 structure
 By adding comments and semantic elements I was able to make the code more accessible
 By fixing some of the style elements I was able to make the site more accessible
